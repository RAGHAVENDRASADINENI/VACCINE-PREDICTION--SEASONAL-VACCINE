# VACCINE-PREDICTION--SEASONAL-VACCINE
 Predict Vaccine Acceptance &amp; Taking based on Independent Variables like  knowledge of both flu, Doctors Recommendations, chronic diseases, behavioral traits etc.

Process – For seasonal vaccine applied relevant pre-processing methods like missing 
imputation and built classification models for prediction. Logistic Regression (Accuracy), 
Decision Tree (Accuracy), Support Vector(Accuracy), Naïve Bayes(Accuracy), etc. like 
ensemble methods and neural network

Learning – Comparative Model performance of different classification models and the impact 
of categorical only independent variables on classification models
